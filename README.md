Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo? => [here](https://teampages.netlify.app/)
- What was your experience? => It was a good experience, I had to do a little research for the vertical text and the nth-child as they were not properties I was familiar with, but they turned out fine.
- What have you learned/improved? => I learned how to resaerch more efficiently using google. I also learned about the nth-child and nth-of-type properties, as well as deepening my knowledge on css grid and flexbox.
- Your wisdom? :) Use Google üòè
